      <p><span class="author">W. Somerset Maugham</span>, an eminent British playwright, novelist and short story writer is better known as a master of short and concise novels. Through these novels, he captured the imagination of the readers by portraying genuine characters and conveying their relationships, greed and ambition in a realistic manner. The magnificent but decaying British Empire offered him amazing canvasses in which he penned his stories and plays. Though as a writer, ‘competent’ was the word critics used to dismiss his work, he was someone who was extremely proud of his creativity and regarded his work ‘in the very top rank of the second rate’, not to forget the fact that the ‘first rate’ included Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Cervantes. Possessing clear and lucid English, his works were very easy for people to come to terms. Most of his characters were interesting and humane that even now, they evoke the day to day feelings and emotions which enable the readers to understand and identify his characters. One of the highly paid writers of his time, his career spanned many ages from the Edwardian era to that of the nuclear and he was successful in both these eras. The fact that many of his novels were adapted to films justifies his place in the present literature.</p>
